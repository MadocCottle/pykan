# Before/After Comparison

## Overview
This document shows the expected improvements from the fixes applied based on the problems identified in `/madoc/section1/visualization/outputs/20251024_035709_results`.

---

## Problem 1: SIREN Noisy Predictions

### Before (20251024_035709_results)
**2D Heatmaps** (poisson_2d_sin, poisson_2d_poly, poisson_2d_highfreq, poisson_2d_spec):
- Extremely noisy, chaotic patterns
- Random spikes in 3D surface plots
- MSE values: 23.9, 0.85, 14618, 38.8
- No resemblance to ground truth

**Evidence**:
```
Dataset 0 (poisson_2d_sin): MSE = 23.948215
Dataset 1 (poisson_2d_poly): MSE = 0.853660
Dataset 2 (poisson_2d_highfreq): MSE = 14618.510742
Dataset 3 (poisson_2d_spec): MSE = 38.868233
```

### After (Expected with Fixes)
**2D Heatmaps**:
- Smooth, continuous surfaces
- MSE < 1.0 for simple functions (datasets 0, 1, 3)
- MSE < 100 for high-freq (dataset 2) - may still be high but smooth
- Predictions follow ground truth shape

**Expected**:
```
Dataset 0 (poisson_2d_sin): MSE < 1.0
Dataset 1 (poisson_2d_poly): MSE < 0.5
Dataset 2 (poisson_2d_highfreq): MSE < 100 (improved but challenging)
Dataset 3 (poisson_2d_spec): MSE < 5.0
```

**Why**:
- Proper initialization prevents gradient explosion
- Adam optimizer with LR schedule provides stability
- Tighter gradient clipping prevents oscillations

## Problem 2: KAN+Pruning Performance Collapse

### Before (20251024_035709_results)
**Loss Curves** (1D Poisson datasets):
- Dataset 0 (poisson_1d_sin): Oscillates at 0.03-0.05 (unstable)
- Dataset 1 (poisson_1d_poly): Oscillates 3e-5 to 2e-4 (very unstable)
- Dataset 2 (poisson_1d_highfreq): **Spikes from ~12 to ~200** (catastrophic)

**Visual Evidence**:
```
Epoch 1: Test Loss = 0.05
Epoch 2: Test Loss = 0.03
Epoch 3: Test Loss = 0.07  <- oscillating
...
Epoch 50: Test Loss = 200  <- spike!
```

### After (Expected with Fixes)
**Loss Curves**:
- Monotonic improvement or stable plateau
- Pruned performance within 2x of base KAN
- No dramatic spikes (>10x loss increase)

**Expected**:
```
Stage 1 (Sparsification with lamb=1e-2):
  Epoch 1: Train Loss = 0.1, Test Loss = 0.12
  ...
  Epoch 200: Train Loss = 0.003, Test Loss = 0.005

Stage 2 (Pruning):
  Parameters: 150 -> 85 (removed 65)
  Metrics after pruning: Dense MSE = 0.008

Stage 3 (Retraining):
  Epoch 1: Train Loss = 0.006, Test Loss = 0.008
  ...
  Epoch 200: Train Loss = 0.002, Test Loss = 0.004

Final pruned model: 85 params, Dense MSE = 0.004e
```

**Why**:
- Sparsification training teaches network which connections matter
- Retraining allows network to adapt to pruned structure
- Gradual 3-stage process prevents sudden performance drops

## Problem 3: Missing KAN Models

### Before (20251024_035709_results)
**Visualization Errors**:
- "Model not available" for KAN in several plots
- No error messages in logs
- Silent failures

**Evidence**:
- Several 2D heatmap plots show "Model not available" for KAN
- No indication of what went wrong

### After (Expected with Fixes)
**Clear Error Messages**:
```
Training KAN: Dataset 2 (poisson_2d_highfreq), grid=20
  Epoch 1/200: Train Loss = 0.1, Test Loss = 0.12
  ...
  ERROR: KAN training failed at grid 20 for dataset 2 (poisson_2d_highfreq)
  Error type: RuntimeError
  Error message: Training produced NaN/Inf values in test loss
  Stopping training for this dataset. Completed 2/6 grids.
```

**Partial Results Saved**:
- Models trained on grids 3, 5 are saved
- Visualizations show partial results with note about failure
- User knows exactly what went wrong

**Why**:
- Try-except blocks catch all errors
- Detailed logging shows error type and message
- Training continues with other datasets

---

## Problem 4: 1D Function Fit Failures

### Before (20251024_035709_results)
**poisson_1d_poly** (Dataset 1):
- KAN shows huge oscillatory spikes (y-axis ±0.0001 scale)
- Predictions don't match ground truth at all

**poisson_1d_highfreq** (Dataset 2):
- MLP: Flat prediction (complete failure)
- SIREN: Noisy but captures some structure
- KAN: Poor fit

### After (Expected with Fixes)
**poisson_1d_poly**:
- KAN: Smooth curve matching ground truth
- Scale is physically correct (small derivatives expected)
- No artificial oscillations

**poisson_1d_highfreq**:
- MLP: **Still fails** (expected - spectral bias)
- SIREN: Smooth, captures high-frequency structure
- KAN: Good fit

**Why**:
- SIREN fixes eliminate noise
- KAN pruning fixes eliminate oscillations
- MLP limitation is architectural (not a bug to fix)

---

## Problem 5: 2D Heatmap Quality

### Before (20251024_035709_results)
**All 2D Heatmaps**:
- SIREN: Completely unusable (pure noise)
- KAN: Missing or failed
- Only MLP provides usable (but suboptimal) results

### After (Expected with Fixes)
**All 2D Heatmaps**:
- **MLP**: Same as before (working baseline)
- **SIREN**: Smooth, high-quality predictions
- **KAN**: Available for all datasets (with error handling)

**Quality Ranking** (expected):
1. KAN (best - captures compositional structure)
2. SIREN (good - smooth periodic functions)
3. MLP (baseline - works but less accurate)

---

## Training Time Comparison

### Before
```
MLP: 100s per dataset
SIREN: 120s per dataset (with divergence issues)
KAN: 200s per dataset
KAN+Pruning: 210s per dataset (but poor results)
```

### After (Expected)
```
MLP: 100s per dataset (unchanged)
SIREN: 200-250s per dataset (2x slower but stable)
KAN: 200s per dataset (unchanged)
KAN+Pruning: 400-450s per dataset (2x longer, 3-stage process)
```

**Trade-off**: Longer training time for better quality and stability

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
| Metric | Before | After (Target) |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| SIREN MSE (2D simple) | >20 | <1.0 |
| KAN+Pruning spikes | Yes (100x) | No (<2x) |
| Silent failures | Yes | No |
| Training divergence | Common | Rare |

### Qualitative
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| SIREN 2D plots | Noisy | Smooth |
| KAN+Pruning curves | Oscillating/spiking | Stable |
| Error messages | None | Clear & detailed |
| Reproducibility | Poor | Good |

---

## How to Verify Improvements

### 1. Run Training
```bash
cd /Users/main/Desktop/my_pykan/pykan/madoc/section1
python section1_2.py --epochs 100
python section1_3.py --epochs 100
```

### 2. Check Logs
Look for:
- ✓ "Stage 1: Sparsification..." (KAN+Pruning)
- ✓ "LR = 1.00e-04" → "LR = 1.00e-05" (SIREN)
- ✓ "Pruning complete: ...s" (KAN+Pruning Stage 2)
- ✓ "Retraining complete: ...s" (KAN+Pruning Stage 3)

### 3. Generate Visualizations
```bash
cd visualization
python plot_best_loss.py
python plot_function_fit.py
python plot_heatmap_2d.py
```

### 4. Compare Results
Look at outputs in `visualization/outputs/[timestamp]_results/`:
- **SIREN 2D heatmaps**: Should be smooth (not noisy)
- **KAN+Pruning loss curves**: Should be stable (not spiking)
- **All models**: Should have valid predictions (not "Model not available")
