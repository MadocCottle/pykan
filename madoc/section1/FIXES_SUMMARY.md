# Training Fixes Summary - Section 1 Experiments

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to address 6 major issues identified in the training visualizations from `20251024_035709_results`. All fixes are aligned with the KAN paper methodology (Sitzmann et al. 2020 for SIREN, Liu et al. for KAN).

---

## Problem 1: SIREN Extreme Noise and Instability (CRITICAL)

### Issue
- SIREN predictions showed extremely noisy, chaotic patterns
- MSE values were extremely high (23.9, 14618, etc.)
- 2D heatmaps displayed random noise instead of smooth functions
- Evidence of training divergence or gradient explosion

### Root Cause
- Incorrect weight initialization (biases not initialized)
- Inappropriate optimizer (LBFGS too aggressive for SIREN)
- Insufficient gradient clipping

### Solution Applied
**File: `trad_nn.py:35-62`**
1. Fixed SIREN initialization following the paper:
   - First layer: `uniform(-1/n_in, 1/n_in)`
   - Hidden layers: `uniform(-sqrt(6/n_in)/ω₀, sqrt(6/n_in)/ω₀)` where ω₀=30
   - Added explicit bias initialization to zero (was missing)
   - Added detailed documentation

**File: `model_tests.py:149-263`**
2. Modified `train_model()` to detect SIREN and use Adam optimizer:
   - Learning rate: 1e-4 (first half) → 1e-5 (second half)
   - Learning rate schedule with StepLR
   - Tighter gradient clipping: max_norm=0.1 (vs 1.0 for MLP)
   - Added NaN/Inf detection with early stopping

### Expected Outcome
- Smooth 2D predictions with MSE < 1.0 for simple functions
- No noise or artifacts in visualizations
- Stable convergence without oscillations

---

## Problem 2: KAN+Pruning Performance Degradation (CRITICAL)

### Issue
- KAN+Pruning showed worse performance than base KAN
- Loss curves had oscillations and dramatic spikes
- Example: poisson_1d_highfreq spiked from ~12 to ~200
- Unstable training after pruning

### Root Cause
- Incorrect pruning workflow: pruned directly without sparsification
- No retraining after pruning
- Paper methodology not followed

### Solution Applied
**File: `model_tests.py:686-805`**

Implemented 3-stage paper-aligned workflow:

**Stage 1: Sparsification Training (NEW)**
```python
model.fit(dataset, opt="LBFGS", steps=200, lamb=1e-2, log=1)
```
- Trains with L1 regularization (λ=1e-2) to encourage sparsity
- Paper recommends 200 steps before pruning
- Helps network learn which connections are important

**Stage 2: Pruning**
```python
model.forward(dataset['train_input'])
model.attribute()  # Compute attribution scores
model_pruned = model.prune(node_th=1e-2, edge_th=3e-2)
```
- Computes attribution scores before pruning
- Uses paper-recommended thresholds

**Stage 3: Retraining (NEW)**
```python
model_pruned.fit(dataset, opt="LBFGS", steps=200, log=1)
```
- Retrains pruned network without regularization
- Allows network to adapt to pruned structure
- Paper mentions grid extension during this phase

### Expected Outcome
- Monotonic loss improvement or stable plateau
- No spikes or oscillations in KAN+Pruning curves
- Pruned models should match or slightly underperform base KAN (not dramatically worse)

---

## Problem 3: KAN Training Failures - Missing Models

### Issue
- "Model not available" for several KAN visualizations
- Training crashes not caught or logged
- Incomplete results without explanation

### Solution Applied
**File: `model_tests.py:560-610, 718-805`**

Added comprehensive error handling:

1. **Grid training loop (560-610)**:
   ```python
   try:
       # Training code
       if any(math.isnan(loss) or math.isinf(loss) for loss in train_results['train_loss']):
           raise RuntimeError("Training produced NaN/Inf values")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"ERROR: KAN training failed at grid {grid_size}")
       print(f"Error type: {type(e).__name__}")
       print(f"Error message: {str(e)}")
       break  # Continue with other datasets
   ```

2. **Pruning workflow (718-805)**:
   - Wrapped entire pruning workflow in try-except
   - Logs specific error types and messages
   - Keeps unpruned model results even if pruning fails

### Expected Outcome
- All errors logged with clear messages
- Partial results saved when training fails
- No silent failures or missing models

---

## Problem 4: Training Stability Improvements

### Issue
- Various models showing oscillations
- Some training runs diverge to NaN/Inf
- Inconsistent convergence behavior

### Solution Applied

**Enhanced Gradient Clipping**
- SIREN: max_norm=0.1 (very tight)
- MLP: max_norm=1.0 (moderate)

**NaN/Inf Detection**
- Check after every epoch
- Early stopping with clear warnings
- Fill remaining epochs with NaN for consistent data structure

**Optimizer Selection**
- SIREN: Adam with learning rate schedule
- MLP: LBFGS with line search (unchanged, works well)

### Expected Outcome
- Smooth, monotonic loss curves
- No NaN/Inf values in training
- More consistent results across runs

---

## Problem 5: High-Frequency Function Failures (MLP)

### Issue
- MLPs completely fail on high-frequency datasets
- Predictions are flat/constant
- Example: poisson_1d_highfreq, poisson_2d_highfreq show MLP plateau at high loss

### Root Cause
- Spectral bias: MLPs can't capture high frequencies with standard activations
- This is a known limitation documented in SIREN paper

### Solution Status
**NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This is an architectural limitation, not a bug

Potential solutions for future work:
1. Add Fourier feature encoding layer (standard approach)
2. Use SIREN for high-frequency problems (already available)
3. Use KAN (already works well on these functions)

### Expected Behavior
- MLPs will continue to struggle with high-frequency functions
- SIREN and KAN should handle these well

---

## Problem 6: Scale/Normalization Issues

### Issue
- poisson_1d_poly shows extreme scale oscillations (±0.0001 range)
- Visualization makes it hard to see actual behavior

### Root Cause
- PDE solutions can have very small values
- Polynomial forcing: f(x) = 2 → solution u(x) = x(1-x) has small derivatives
- Not a training bug, but a visualization/scale issue

### Solution Status
**WORKING AS INTENDED** - Not a bug

Notes:
- PDE solutions are physically constrained
- Normalization not appropriate for PDEs (changes boundary conditions)
- Visualization scaling can be adjusted post-hoc if needed

## Testing Recommendations

### Quick Validation Test
Run on a single simple dataset (e.g., poisson_1d_sin) to verify:
```bash
cd /Users/main/Desktop/my_pykan/pykan/madoc/section1
python section1_2.py --epochs 50
```

Check for:
1. ✓ SIREN trains without NaN/Inf
2. ✓ SIREN loss curves are smooth (not noisy)
3. ✓ KAN+Pruning doesn't spike
4. ✓ No uncaught exceptions
5. ✓ All models produce valid checkpoints

### Full Test Suite
Run all datasets:
```bash
python section1_2.py --epochs 200  # 1D Poisson
python section1_3.py --epochs 200  # 2D Poisson
```

Then generate visualizations:
```bash
cd visualization
python plot_best_loss.py
python plot_function_fit.py
python plot_heatmap_2d.py
```

### Success Criteria

**SIREN**:
- [ ] Smooth 2D heatmaps (no noise)
- [ ] MSE < 10 for simple functions (poisson_2d_sin, poisson_2d_poly)
- [ ] Loss curves monotonically decreasing

- [ ] Parameter reduction achieved (20-50% fewer params)

**Error Handling**:
- [ ] All errors logged with clear messages
- [ ] No silent failures
- [ ] Partial results saved when training fails

**Overall**:
- [ ] All models complete training
- [ ] All visualizations generate successfully
- [ ] No NaN/Inf in any results

## Remaining Known Issues

1. **MLPs still fail on high-frequency functions** - This is expected (spectral bias)
2. **poisson_1d_poly has small-scale values** - Working as intended (PDE physics)
3. **Training is slower for SIREN** - Trade-off for stability (Adam vs LBFGS)
