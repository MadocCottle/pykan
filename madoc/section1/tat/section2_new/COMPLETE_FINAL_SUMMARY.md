    population_size=20,
    n_generations=30,
    selection_method='tournament',
    n_elite=2
)

# Evolve optimal architecture
best_genome, history = evolver.evolve(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)

# Get best model
best_model = best_genome.to_model()

# Access Pareto frontier
pareto_solutions = evolver.get_pareto_frontier()
```

## What Can You Do Now

### 1. Train Ensembles

from section2_new.ensemble.expert_training import KANExpertEnsemble
ensemble = KANExpertEnsemble(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=16, output_dim=1, n_experts=10)
ensemble.train_experts(X_train, y_train, epochs=200)
y_pred, uncertainty = ensemble.predict_with_uncertainty(X_test)
```

### 2. Use Adaptive Densification
```python
from section2_new.models.adaptive_selective_kan import AdaptiveSelectiveKAN
kan = AdaptiveSelectiveKAN(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=10, output_dim=1,
                           initial_grid=5, max_grid=20)
trainer = AdaptiveSelectiveTrainer(kan, densify_every=50, densify_k=3)
trainer.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=500)
```

### 3. Population-Based Training
```python
from section2_new.population.population_trainer import PopulationBasedKANTrainer
trainer = PopulationBasedKANTrainer(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=10, output_dim=1,
                                   population_size=10, sync_frequency=50)
trainer.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=500)
best_model = trainer.get_best_model()
```

### 4. **Evolve Optimal Architectures** ðŸ†•
```python
from section2_new.evolution.evolutionary_search import EvolutionaryKANSearch

evolver = EvolutionaryKANSearch(
    input_dim=3, output_dim=1,
    population_size=20, n_generations=30
)

best_genome, history = evolver.evolve(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
best_model = best_genome.to_model()

# Multi-objective solutions
pareto_frontier = evolver.get_pareto_frontier()
for sol in pareto_frontier:
    print(f"Accuracy: {sol.objectives[0]:.3f}, "
          f"Complexity: {sol.objectives[1]}, "
          f"Speed: {sol.objectives[2]:.1f}s")
```

- Enhanced scenario generation

**Status:** Foundation ready, can be added as future enhancement
