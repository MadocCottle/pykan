# Quick Reference: Training Improvements

## What Was Fixed

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: SIREN Training Stability
**Before**: Noisy predictions, MSE > 14000, training divergence
**After**: Smooth predictions, stable convergence, Adam optimizer with LR schedule

**Key Changes**:
- Fixed weight initialization (added bias init)
- Switch from LBFGS to Adam (lr=1e-4 â†’ 1e-5)
- Tighter gradient clipping (max_norm=0.1)

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: KAN Pruning Workflow
**Before**: Direct pruning â†’ performance degradation, loss spikes
**After**: 3-stage workflow â†’ stable pruned networks

**Paper-Aligned Workflow**:
1. **Sparsify**: Train 200 steps with lamb=1e-2
2. **Prune**: Remove insignificant nodes/edges
3. **Retrain**: Train 200 steps to adapt

### âœ… Error Handling
**Before**: Silent failures, missing models
**After**: All errors logged with clear messages

## How to Test

### Quick Test (5-10 min)
```bash
cd /Users/main/Desktop/my_pykan/pykan/madoc/section1
python section1_2.py --epochs 50
```

Look for:
- âœ“ "Sparsification complete" in KAN+Pruning logs
- âœ“ "LR = 1.00e-04" then "LR = 1.00e-05" in SIREN logs
- âœ“ No "ERROR:" messages
- âœ“ All models complete

### Generate Visualizations
```bash
cd visualization
python plot_best_loss.py
python plot_function_fit.py
python plot_heatmap_2d.py
```

### What to Check in Graphs

**SIREN (2D heatmaps)**:
- âœ“ Smooth surfaces (not spiky/noisy)
- âœ“ MSE < 10 for simple functions

**KAN+Pruning (loss curves)**:
- âœ“ No dramatic spikes (>10x loss increase)
- âœ“ Monotonic or stable after pruning

---

## Expected Behavior Changes

### SIREN
- **Training Time**: ~2x slower (Adam vs LBFGS) - this is normal
- **Convergence**: Smoother, more stable
- **Log Output**: Shows learning rate transitions

### KAN+Pruning
- **Training Time**: ~2x longer (sparsify + retrain stages)
- **Log Output**: 3-stage workflow clearly visible
- **Performance**: Should be within 2x of base KAN (not 10-100x worse)

### All Models
- **Error Messages**: More verbose, all errors logged
- **Partial Results**: Saved even if training fails

---

## Still Expected to Fail

These are NOT bugs:

1. **MLPs on high-frequency functions** - Known limitation (spectral bias)
2. **poisson_1d_poly small values** - Physics constraint (PDE solution)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "SIREN still noisy"
- Check: Is Adam optimizer being used? (look for "LR = " in logs)
- Check: Are there NaN/Inf warnings?

### "KAN+Pruning still spikes"
- Check: Do you see 3 stages in logs? (sparsify â†’ prune â†’ retrain)
- Check: Is lamb=1e-2 being used in Stage 1?

### "Training very slow"
- Expected: SIREN is 2x slower (Adam), KAN+Pruning is 2x longer (3 stages)
- Not expected: If >5x slower, may indicate different issue

## Quick Validation Checklist

Run a test and check logs for:

- [ ] SIREN: "LR = 1.00e-04" â†’ "LR = 1.00e-05"
- [ ] SIREN: No noise warnings
- [ ] KAN+Pruning: "Stage 1: Sparsification..."
- [ ] KAN+Pruning: "Stage 2: Pruning..."
- [ ] KAN+Pruning: "Stage 3: Retraining..."
- [ ] All: "Final Dense MSE = " for each model
- [ ] All: No uncaught exceptions

Then check visualizations:

- [ ] SIREN 2D plots are smooth
- [ ] KAN+Pruning curves don't spike
- [ ] All models have valid predictions
