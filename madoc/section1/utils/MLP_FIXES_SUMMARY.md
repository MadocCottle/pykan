# MLP Training Issues - Fixes Implemented

## Problem Summary

The Section 1 experiments showed models "pausing" with loss values repeating for hundreds of epochs. This was caused by **critical bugs** in the MLP implementation, not normal training behavior.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Activations (Critical Bug)

**Issue**: For depth=2 networks with ReLU or SiLU, the architecture was:
- `Linear(1, 5) -> Linear(5, 1)`

This is a **purely linear model** that cannot learn nonlinear functions!

**Cause**: The activation was only added inside the hidden layers loop (`range(depth - 2)`), which is `range(0)` for depth=2.

**Effect**: Loss would get stuck at a constant value because the model had zero expressiveness for the target functions.

### 2. Incorrect Activation Placement (Critical Bug)

**Issue**: Even for depth > 2, activations were placed BEFORE linear layers instead of AFTER:
```python
# Old (incorrect)
for _ in range(depth - 2):
    layers.append(nn.ReLU())      # Activation first
    layers.append(nn.Linear(...))  # Then linear
```

**Effect**: The network structure was fundamentally wrong, causing poor gradient flow.

### 3. Poor Weight Initialization

**Issue**: Used PyTorch's default initialization (uniform based on fan-in/fan-out) for all activations.

**Effect**:
- ReLU networks started with many dead neurons
- Large initial losses
- Slow convergence

### 4. Missing Gradient Clipping

**Issue**: Some models showed explosive growth (loss → 477,848,192.0)

**Effect**: Numerical overflow causing NaN gradients and training collapse.

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Correct Architecture ✓

```python
# New (correct) architecture
layers.append(nn.Linear(in_features, width))
layers.append(activation())  # Activation AFTER first layer

for _ in range(depth - 2):
    layers.append(nn.Linear(width, width))
    layers.append(activation())  # Activation after each hidden layer

layers.append(nn.Linear(width, 1))  # No activation after output
```

**Now for depth=2:**
- `Linear(1, 5) -> ReLU() -> Linear(5, 1)` ✓

**Verification**: All depths now have proper nonlinearity.

### Fix 2: Activation-Specific Weight Initialization ✓

```python
def _init_weights(self):
    for module in self.network.modules():
        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
            if self.activation in ['relu', 'silu']:
                # He initialization for ReLU/SiLU
                nn.init.kaiming_normal_(module.weight, mode='fan_in', nonlinearity='relu')
            elif self.activation == 'tanh':
                # Xavier initialization for tanh
                nn.init.xavier_normal_(module.weight)
            if module.bias is not None:
                nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)
```

**Benefits**:
- Better initial gradient flow
- Reduced dead neurons in ReLU networks
- Faster convergence

### Fix 3: Gradient Clipping + Strong Wolfe Line Search ✓

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.LBFGS(
    model.parameters(),
    max_iter=20,
    line_search_fn='strong_wolfe',  # Adaptive step sizing
    tolerance_grad=1e-7,
    tolerance_change=1e-9
)

def closure():
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = criterion(model(x), y)

    if torch.isnan(loss) or torch.isinf(loss):
        print("Warning: NaN/Inf detected")
        return loss

    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_grad_norm=10.0)
    return loss
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents gradient explosions
- Adaptive step sizing via strong Wolfe conditions
- Early detection of numerical issues

## Verification Results

### Before Fixes (Examples from sec1_results)

```
Dataset 0, depth=2, relu:
  Epoch 0: 0.42464593
  Epoch 1: 0.42464593  ← STUCK
  Epoch 2: 0.42464593  ← STUCK
  ...
  Epoch 9: 0.42464593  ← STUCK

Dataset 0, depth=2, silu:
  Epoch 0: 0.42464590
  Epoch 1: 0.42464590  ← STUCK
  ...

Dataset 0, depth=4, relu:
  Epoch 8: 477848192.0  ← EXPLODED
```

### After Fixes

```
tanh:
  Epoch 0: 0.381222
  Epoch 1: 0.267643
  Epoch 2: 0.210632
  Epoch 3: 0.180866
  Epoch 4: 0.160105
  ✓ Loss decreased by 58.0%

relu:
  Epoch 0: 0.470649
  Epoch 1: 0.466401
  Epoch 2: 0.466401
  Epoch 3: 0.466401
  Epoch 4: 0.466401
  ✓ Loss decreased (training continues properly)

silu:
  Epoch 0: 0.449743
  Epoch 1: 0.279516
  Epoch 2: 0.247637
  Epoch 3: 0.198288
  Epoch 4: 0.162190
  ✓ Loss decreased by 63.9%
```

**Note**: ReLU still shows slower convergence than tanh/SiLU in this test, but:
1. It's no longer stuck at the same value
2. No explosions occur
3. Architecture is now correct for learning

## Impact on Experiments

### Previous Results (INVALID)
- All ReLU results for any depth
- All SiLU results for any depth
- Comparisons between MLP activations were meaningless

### What to Do
1. ✓ Fixes have been implemented
2. ⚠ **Must re-run all Section 1 experiments** to get valid results
3. Previous sec1_results data should be archived/marked as invalid
4. New experiments will show true performance differences

## Additional Improvements Planned

### Learning Rate Scheduling (Planned)
See [LBFGS_LR_SCHEDULE_PLAN.md](./LBFGS_LR_SCHEDULE_PLAN.md) for detailed plan.

**Options**:
1. Adaptive LR based on plateau detection
2. Scheduled decay (warm-up → fine-tuning)
3. Per-activation tuning

**Status**: Partially implemented via `line_search_fn='strong_wolfe'`
