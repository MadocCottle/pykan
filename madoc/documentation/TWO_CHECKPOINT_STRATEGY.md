# Two-Checkpoint Strategy for Section 2

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the two-checkpoint comparison strategy for Section 2 experiments. This strategy enables **iso-compute comparisons** by capturing model performance at two critical points:

1. **At Interpolation Threshold**: When the reference approach reaches its optimal performance (before overfitting)
2. **At Final Training**: When all approaches have exhausted their training budget

## Motivation

### The Problem

KANs and other neural network approaches have different convergence behaviors:
- Some converge rapidly to a plateau (e.g., LBFGS)
- Others improve slowly but monotonically (e.g., Adam)
- Some may overfit after reaching optimal capacity (interpolation threshold)

This creates unfair comparisons if we only look at "final" models:
- **Fast Optimizer@final**: May have plateaued, showing no recent improvement
- **Slow Optimizer@final**: Still improving, appears better than it actually is
- **Result**: Cannot determine which approach is fundamentally better

### The Solution

Capture two checkpoints for each approach:

**Checkpoint 1: At Reference Threshold Time T**
- **Reference approach** (e.g., LBFGS): At interpolation threshold (optimal performance)
- **Other approaches**: After T seconds of training
- **Shows**: "Reference achieves X performance in time T; others achieve Y in same time"
- **Fair comparison**: All approaches evaluated at same computational budget

**Checkpoint 2: Final (after full budget)**
- **All approaches**: After complete training
- **Shows**: "Given unlimited time, who performs best?"
- **Long-run behavior**: Asymptotic performance comparison

## Implementation for Section 2

### Section 2.1: Optimizer Comparison

**Research Question**: Which optimizer (Adam, LBFGS, LM) converges fastest for KAN training?

**Reference Approach**: LBFGS (typically fastest, most stable)

**Checkpoints**:
```python
checkpoints[dataset_idx] = {
    'at_threshold': {
        'model': model,              # Saved model state
        'epoch': threshold_epoch,    # Epoch when threshold reached
        'time': threshold_time,      # Time to reach threshold (seconds)
        'train_loss': float,
        'test_loss': float,
        'dense_mse': float,          # Primary metric
        'grid_size': int,
        'num_params': int,
        'optimizer': str
    },
    'final': {
        'model': model,
        'epoch': final_epoch,
        'time': total_time,
        'train_loss': float,
        'test_loss': float,
        'dense_mse': float,
        'grid_size': int,
        'num_params': int,
        'optimizer': str
    }
}
```

**Key Findings Enable**:
- Speed advantage quantification: "LM reaches target MSE 20% faster than LBFGS"
- Asymptotic behavior: "All optimizers converge to similar final performance"
- Dataset-specific insights: "Adam excels on high-frequency problems"

### Section 2.2: Adaptive Density Comparison

**Research Question**: Does adaptive density provide speed advantages over baseline refinement?

**Reference Approach**: Baseline (regular refinement only)

**Three Approaches Compared**:
1. **Adaptive Only**: Alternative to regular refinement (uses attribution scores)
2. **Adaptive+Regular**: Combined approach (regular + selective densification)
3. **Baseline**: Regular refinement only (control)

**Checkpoints**: Same structure as Section 2.1, with `'approach'` field instead of `'optimizer'`

**Key Findings Enable**:
- Attribution effectiveness: "Adaptive identifies important neurons early"
- Speed advantage: "Adaptive reaches target MSE 15% faster on sparse problems"
- Generalization: "No advantage on problems where all neurons are important"

### Section 2.3: Merge_KAN

**Note**: Section 2.3 uses a different experimental design focused on expert merging rather than temporal comparisons. It has **early stopping** built into the training process but does not use the two-checkpoint strategy as it's not comparing multiple approaches at specific time points.

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Threshold Detection Function

Located in: `section2/utils/optimizer_tests.py`

```python
def detect_kan_threshold(test_losses, patience=2, threshold=0.05):
    """Detect when KAN starts overfitting (test loss increases)

    Args:
        test_losses: List of test losses over training
        patience: Number of consecutive increases needed (default: 2)
        threshold: Relative increase to count as degradation (default: 5%)

    Returns:
        Index of epoch where threshold was reached
    """
    best_loss = float('inf')
    worse_count = 0
    best_epoch = 0

    for i, loss in enumerate(test_losses):
        if loss < best_loss:
            best_loss = loss
            best_epoch = i
            worse_count = 0
        elif loss > best_loss * (1 + threshold):
            worse_count += 1
            if worse_count >= patience:
                return best_epoch  # Before degradation started
        else:
            worse_count = 0

    return best_epoch  # Never degraded significantly
```

**Key Parameters**:
- `patience=2`: Requires 2 consecutive epochs of degradation (avoids false positives)
- `threshold=0.05`: 5% relative increase defines "degradation"

**Design Rationale**:
- Conservative approach (2 epochs) prevents stopping on noise
- 5% threshold balances sensitivity vs. robustness
- Returns best epoch (before degradation) not first bad epoch

### 2. Modified Training Functions

All training functions now return: `(DataFrame, checkpoints_dict, threshold_time)`

**Before (Phase 0)**:
```python
def run_kan_optimizer_tests(...):
    # ... training logic ...
    return pd.DataFrame(rows), models
```

**After (Phase 1)**:
```python
def run_kan_optimizer_tests(...):
    # ... training logic ...

    # Detect threshold
    threshold_epoch = detect_kan_threshold(test_losses)

    # Calculate time to threshold
    cumulative_time = calculate_threshold_time(grid_times, threshold_epoch)

    # Create checkpoints
    checkpoints[dataset_idx] = {
        'at_threshold': {...},
        'final': {...}
    }

    return pd.DataFrame(rows), checkpoints, avg_threshold_time
```

**Functions Updated**:
- `run_kan_optimizer_tests()` - Section 2.1 (Adam, LBFGS, LM)
- `run_kan_lm_tests()` - Section 2.1 (LM specific)
- `run_kan_adaptive_density_test()` - Section 2.2 (adaptive approaches)
- `run_kan_baseline_test()` - Section 2.2 (baseline)

### 3. Orchestration Changes

**Section 2.1: Optimizer Training Order**

**Before**:
```python
adam_results, adam_models = run_kan_optimizer_tests(..., "Adam", ...)
lbfgs_results, lbfgs_models = run_kan_optimizer_tests(..., "LBFGS", ...)
lm_results, lm_models = run_kan_lm_tests(...)
```

**After**:
```python
# Train LBFGS FIRST to establish reference
lbfgs_results, lbfgs_checkpoints, lbfgs_threshold_time = run_kan_optimizer_tests(..., "LBFGS", ...)

print(f"Using LBFGS threshold time for reference: {lbfgs_threshold_time:.2f}s")

# Train others (they also detect their own thresholds)
adam_results, adam_checkpoints, adam_threshold_time = run_kan_optimizer_tests(..., "Adam", ...)
lm_results, lm_checkpoints, lm_threshold_time = run_kan_lm_tests(...)
```

**Rationale**: LBFGS typically fastest, establishes reference point for analysis

**Section 2.2: Approach Training Order**

```python
# Train baseline FIRST to establish reference
baseline_results, baseline_checkpoints, baseline_threshold_time = run_kan_baseline_test(...)

# Train adaptive approaches
adaptive_only_results, adaptive_only_checkpoints, ... = run_kan_adaptive_density_test(...)
adaptive_regular_results, adaptive_regular_checkpoints, ... = run_kan_adaptive_density_test(...)
```

### 4. Checkpoint Storage

**File Structure**:
```
section2/results/sec1_results/
├── section2_1_20251024_143022_e10_adam.pkl                    # DataFrame
├── section2_1_20251024_143022_e10_adam_0_at_threshold         # KAN checkpoint
├── section2_1_20251024_143022_e10_adam_0_at_threshold_config.yml

├── section2_1_20251024_143022_e10_adam_0_final_config.yml
├── section2_1_20251024_143022_e10_adam_0_final_state
├── ... (LBFGS and LM checkpoints for all datasets)
└── section2_1_20251024_143022_e10_checkpoint_metadata.pkl     # Metadata only
```

**Checkpoint Metadata File**:
```python
{
    'adam': {
        0: {  # dataset_idx
            'at_threshold': {
                'epoch': 23,
                'time': 45.2,
                'dense_mse': 3.4e-4,
                ...  # Everything except 'model'
            },
            'final': {...}
        },
        1: {...}
    },
    'lbfgs': {...},
    'lm': {...}
}
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Model weights saved separately (large files)
- Metadata in pickle (small, easy to load)
- Can analyze performance without loading full models
- Enables quick comparison across many runs

### 5. Enhanced save_run() Function

Located in: `section2/utils/io.py`

**New Parameters**:
```python
def save_run(results, section, models=None, checkpoints=None, **meta):
    """
    Args:
        checkpoints: Dict[optimizer -> Dict[dataset_idx -> Dict[checkpoint_name -> checkpoint_data]]]
        **meta: Can include 'lbfgs_threshold_time' or 'baseline_threshold_time'
    """
```

**Key Features**:
- Saves both checkpoint types (at_threshold, final)
- Handles KAN models (saveckpt method) and PyTorch models (state_dict)
- Creates separate checkpoint_metadata.pkl for easy access
- Adds threshold_time to DataFrame.attrs metadata
- Backward compatible with old `models` parameter

### 6. Metadata Storage

**DataFrame Attributes**:
```python
df.attrs = {
    'section': 'section2_1',
    'timestamp': '20251024_143022',
    'epochs': 10,
    'device': 'cpu',
    'lbfgs_threshold_time': 45.2,      # Section 2.1
    'baseline_threshold_time': 52.1,   # Section 2.2
    'model_type': 'adam'
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Self-contained DataFrames (metadata travels with data)
- No separate JSON files needed
- Preserved in pickle format
- Threshold time stored for reference

## Usage Examples

    checkpoints = pickle.load(f)

# Access LBFGS reference time
lbfgs_threshold_time = meta['lbfgs_threshold_time']

# Compare optimizers on dataset 0
for opt in ['adam', 'lbfgs', 'lm']:
    threshold_mse = checkpoints[opt][0]['at_threshold']['dense_mse']
    threshold_time = checkpoints[opt][0]['at_threshold']['time']
    final_mse = checkpoints[opt][0]['final']['dense_mse']

    print(f"{opt.upper()}:")
    print(f"  At threshold: MSE={threshold_mse:.6e}, time={threshold_time:.2f}s")
    print(f"  Final: MSE={final_mse:.6e}")
    print(f"  Speedup vs LBFGS: {(lbfgs_threshold_time/threshold_time - 1)*100:.1f}%")
```

## Key Findings and Insights

### Expected Results: Section 2.1

**Speed Comparison (Iso-Compute)**:
```
At LBFGS threshold (45s):
  Adam:   5.2e-4  (15% worse)
  LBFGS:  3.4e-4  (reference)
  LM:     3.1e-4  (9% better)
```
**Conclusion**: LM reaches better accuracy faster than LBFGS

**Final Comparison (200s)**:
```
After full training:
  Adam:   2.8e-4  (eventually competitive)
  LBFGS:  2.7e-4
  LM:     2.6e-4  (slight edge)
```
**Conclusion**: All converge to similar values; speed is main differentiator

**Time to Threshold**:
```
  Adam:   80s   (77% slower)
  LBFGS:  45s   (baseline)
  LM:     41s   (9% faster)
```
**Conclusion**: LM fastest for KAN training

### Expected Results: Section 2.2

**Speed Comparison (Iso-Compute)**:
```
At baseline threshold (52s):
  Adaptive Only:    4.1e-4  (Similar)
  Adaptive+Regular: 3.8e-4  (8% better)
  Baseline:         4.0e-4  (reference)
```
**Conclusion**: Combined approach has slight speed advantage

**Final Comparison**:
```
After full training:
  Adaptive Only:    3.0e-4
  Adaptive+Regular: 2.9e-4  (Best)
  Baseline:         3.0e-4
```
**Conclusion**: Adaptive+Regular has slight quality edge

**Dataset Dependency**:
- **High-frequency problems**: Adaptive density helps (sparse importance)
- **Smooth problems**: No advantage (all neurons important)
- **Polynomial problems**: Mixed results

## Design Rationale

### Why Two Checkpoints (Not More)?

**Considered Alternatives**:
1. **Every N epochs**: Too much storage, analysis overhead
2. **Every grid refinement**: Better, but still many checkpoints
3. **Three checkpoints**: Add "mid-training" but adds complexity

**Chosen Approach (Two Checkpoints)**:
- **At threshold**: Captures "optimal stopping point"
- **Final**: Captures "asymptotic behavior"
- Minimal storage overhead
- Answers key research questions
- Simple to understand and communicate

### Why Detect Threshold Per Approach?

Each approach has its own convergence characteristics:
- LBFGS may reach threshold at 45s
- Adam may reach threshold at 80s
- Both checkpoints capture "optimal" for that approach

This enables:
- Fairness analysis: "At LBFGS's optimal, where is Adam?"
- Self-comparison: "How much does each improve after threshold?"
- Convergence characteristics: "Which plateaus vs. continues improving?"

### Why 5% Threshold, 2 Epochs Patience?

**5% Threshold**:
- Balances sensitivity (detect real overfitting) vs. noise (random fluctuations)
- Tested on multiple datasets, works well in practice
- Consistent with literature on interpolation thresholds

**2 Epochs Patience**:
- Single bad epoch could be noise (especially with small batch sizes)
- 2 consecutive increases confirms trend
- Not too conservative (would miss threshold if patience too high)

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Checkpoint Models Are Final Models**
   - We save metrics at threshold but can't perfectly recover model state
   - Model saved is final trained model (approximation)
   - **Impact**: Metrics accurate, but can't rewind training exactly
   - **Mitigation**: Document this limitation, metrics are primary goal

2. **Dense MSE Computation Cost**
   - Computing on 10,000 samples adds overhead
   - Done twice per dataset (threshold + final)
   - **Impact**: ~5-10% training time increase
   - **Mitigation**: Acceptable for analysis value provided

3. **Fixed Threshold Parameters**
   - 5% and 2 epochs hardcoded, may not be optimal for all problems
   - **Impact**: May miss threshold on very noisy problems
   - **Mitigation**: Works well in practice, can be tuned if needed

### Future Enhancements

**Tier 1 (High Priority)**:
- Save actual model state at threshold during training (not after)
- Implement early stopping based on threshold (optional mode)
- Add confidence intervals via bootstrapping

**Tier 2 (Medium Priority)**:
- Adaptive threshold detection (tune parameters per problem)
- Additional checkpoints at percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%)
- Checkpoint compression (reduce storage)

**Tier 3 (Research)**:
- Theoretical analysis of threshold detection
- Comparison with other stopping criteria
- Optimal checkpoint placement strategies

## Comparison with Section 1

### Similarities

- Both use two-checkpoint strategy
- Both detect interpolation threshold
- Both save checkpoint metadata separately
- Both use same `detect_kan_threshold()` logic

### Differences

| Aspect | Section 1 | Section 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Comparison Type** | Model types (MLP, SIREN, KAN) | Optimizers/Approaches within KAN |
| **Reference** | KAN threshold time | LBFGS/Baseline threshold time |
| **Checkpoint Names** | `at_kan_threshold_time`, `at_threshold` | `at_threshold` only |
| **Primary Goal** | Show KAN speed advantage | Compare optimizer/approach speed |
| **Training Order** | KANs first (establish reference) | LBFGS/Baseline first (establish reference) |
| **Metadata Field** | `kan_threshold_time` | `lbfgs_threshold_time` or `baseline_threshold_time` |

## Troubleshooting

### Checkpoint metadata file not found

**Symptom**: Error loading checkpoint_metadata.pkl

**Solution**:
1. Check that experiment completed successfully
2. Verify save_run() was called with checkpoints parameter
3. Look for `*_checkpoint_metadata.pkl` file in results directory

### Threshold not detected

**Symptom**: Threshold epoch = final epoch (never detected degradation)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Test loss never increased (model still improving)
2. Increases too small (<5%)
3. Only single bad epochs (need 2 consecutive)

**Solutions**:
- Normal if model hasn't overfit yet
- May need more training epochs
- Check test_losses array for patterns

### Missing checkpoints for some datasets

**Symptom**: Some dataset_idx keys missing in checkpoints dict

**Possible Causes**:
1. Training failed for those datasets (NaN losses)
2. Insufficient epochs to complete any grids

**Solutions**:
- Check training logs for errors
- Ensure enough epochs for at least one grid
