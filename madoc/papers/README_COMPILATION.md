### Compilation Commands
```bash
cd /Users/main/Desktop/my_pykan/pykan/madoc/papers
pdflatex section.tex
pdflatex section.tex  # Second pass for cross-references
```

### Minor Notes
- Two overfull hbox warnings (cosmetic typesetting issues, not errors)
- Bibliography uses inline citations (embedded in document) rather than external .bib file
- All figures load correctly and are properly positioned

## How to Recompile
```bash
cd /Users/main/Desktop/my_pykan/pykan/madoc/papers
pdflatex section.tex
```
